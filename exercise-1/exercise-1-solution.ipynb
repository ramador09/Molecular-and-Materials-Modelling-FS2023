    "\n",
    "Welcome to Molecular and Materials Modelling in the Spring Semester 2023 at the ETH\n",
    "Zürich. This interdisciplinary course will explore many facets of computational physics and\n",
    "materials science using classical, semi-classical, and quantum-mechanical methodologies.\n",
    "In this course, we will gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the ability to select a suitable atomistic approach to model a nanoscale system,\n",
    "and to employ a simulation package to compute quantities, thereby providing a\n",
    "theoretically-sound explanation of the results of a given experiment;\n",
    "\n",
    "- knowledge of empirical force fields and insight into electronic structure theory, with\n",
    "emphasis on density-functional theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- proficiency in experiments performed in silico. We will interpret the experimental in-\n",
    "put, choose the level of theory, model the approximations, perform calculations on a\n",

    "\n",
    "The meeting times and places of this course are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semester: Spring Semester 2023\n",
    "- Wednesdays: lecture from 8.15 - 10.00;\n",
    "- Credit points: 4 LP (dt. *Leistungspunkte*)\n",
    "- Meeting place: ETZ E9 in ETH Zentrum\n",
    "- Final grade: The final grade will be the result of a 30 minutes individual oral exam\n",
    "on the course topics (50%) and the cumulative grade about exercises assigned after\n",
    "each exercise appointment (50%). The students will receive a small computational\n",
    "exercise about the topics treated in the class, that could be solved within different\n",
    "programming environments (we provide python based Jupyter notebooks) and if\n",
    "necessary high performance computing resources. A short report and/or answer to\n",
    "a few questions will be delivered at the next lecture appointment. At the end of the\n",
    "oral exam, the solutions will be briefly discussed and a grade will be given which\n",
    "will take into account the commitment and the quality of the solutions/report, as\n",
    "well as the discussion on them at the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments are designed to allow the students to apply the content of the lecture in a\n",
    "hands-on setting. As such, they constitute an integral aspect of the course – a fact reflected\n",
    "in their weighting of 50% of the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments are to be completed within the Jupyter notebook itself, **within the\n",
    "respective fields in which they appear** in the exercise-i-workbook.ipynb file. For\n",
    "answers which are to be written in text (an explanation or elucidation of a phenomenon,\n",
    "for instance), the cell should be in the markdown format. For answers involving bash\n",
    "scripting, the `<code></code>` environment within the markdown format should suffice.\n",
    "Standard Python code can be written directly in the cell. All assignments, which are to\n",
    "be submitted for grading, will appear in a box such as this:"
