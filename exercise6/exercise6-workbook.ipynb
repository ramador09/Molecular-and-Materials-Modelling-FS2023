    "# Exercise 5: the formation of molecular oxygen using molecular orbital theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise examines the formation of **triplet oxygen**, the most stable and most common allotropic form of O$_2$. Triplet oxygen has two electrons in its two **degenerate** (i.e., having the same energy, or, more formally, two distinct microstates corresponding to the same macrostate) $\\pi^*$ orbitals. There are four independent spin states arising from these two spin-1/2 electrons, and so there are a total of $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible ways (microstates) to arrange the two electrons into the two degenerate $\\pi^*$ orbitals. Here, we will only consider the triply-degenerate ground state: according to **Hund's rules**, the configuration with two unpaired electrons in two $\\pi^*$ orbitals is energetically favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, you will generate a [molecular orbital schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_oxygen#/media/File:Valence_orbitals_of_oxygen_atom_and_dioxygen_molecule_(diagram).svg) for triplet oxygen, that is, the configuration for which the total spin equals 1."
