    "In this exercise we will investigate a very important chemical reaction, namely the production of ethene (ethylene) from ethanol. Ethanol is heated with an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature of 170°C. The gases produced are passed through sodium hydroxide solution to remove the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide produced from side reactions. Another way to favor this reaction is in presence of a catalyst surface, which makes the reaction exothermic even at room temperature, and the free energy barrier for the reaction is highly reduced, so to obtain reasonable reaction rates. The use of hematite (an iron-based nanocrystal) as a catalyst is described computationally in [this paper (clickable link)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/RA/C6RA08509A#!divAbstract) by Lopes *et. al.*. We are interested in the gas phase reaction, in particular in the reactants and the products energy, to estimate the “energy of reaction”.\n",

    "In the supplementary material of the paper, which can be found [here](http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/c6/ra/c6ra08509a/c6ra08509a1.pdf), several calculations with different methods ranging from DFT to hybrid methods to even higher-level methods are described, together with the basis set dependence of the results. We will compare our results with those published by performing calculations within the DFT framework for two different functionals: the PBE parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), introduced in Exercise 7, and the hybrid functional B3LYP (named after those who developed it: Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr); within each functional we will optimize the geometry at two-three basis sets per functional, thereby obtaining a final (hopefully converged!) value for the total inner energy $U$. From here we will use thermodynamics to relate $U$ to the Gibbs free energy $G$; see the Figure below:\n",
